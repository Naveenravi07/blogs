      <p>It's about 1:28 AM, and I'm writing my very first blog. For the past month, I've been thinking about
starting a blog, but I kept procrastinating and wasting my time. I knew I was wasting my time, but I
just couldn't find the motivation to begin. It felt like I was stuck, unable to start. I tried
learning some technologies, but nothing changed. And today, for God's sake, somehow I got the
motivation to start this. Right now, I've almost covered the technical part of it. <span id="continue-reading"></span></p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-the-deal-here"><strong>So what's the deal here?</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>This blog is going to be a part of my <a href="https://theshastri.xyz">website</a>, and I have some plans to
keep this blog for my whole life. This way, I can document my life and share my thoughts and
experiences, and people can know me even after I die.</li>
<li>I might shitpost  here like i do in twitter.</li>
<li>I also really want to improve my English, and this seems like a great way for me.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="on-this-blog-i-will-write-about"><strong>On this blog, I will write about... ?</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>My life.</li>
<li>Software and tools.</li>
<li>Movies/TV shows.</li>
<li>It can be anything, so this list is not exhaustive.</li>
</ol>

<p>don't expect high literature from me. I write in the exact same manner as I speak. I would love to
get corrected, so if you find any spelling or grammar mistakes, please feel free to point them out.
