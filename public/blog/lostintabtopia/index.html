    <h1>Lost in Tabtopia? Vim Saved Me (and My Sanity)</h1>
    
    <p class="secondary">26 December, 2023</p>
    
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>To be honest, I was also a heavy mouse user. I started using Windows when I was
around 16, and I used &quot;VSCode&quot; for programming. I heavily relied on the mouse
for switching tabs, browsing the internet, and programming. Switching between
tabs and finding the right one was the worst. It felt like a nightmare  <span id="continue-reading"></span> —I had
to decide where to go from the list of applications when I pressed ALT+TAB. </p>
<p>Speaking of programming in VSCode, I didn't remember many shortcuts, except for
Ctrl+P, Ctrl+F, and Ctrl+Shift+F. I know there are a few more, but the editor
itself didn't compel me to use them. I was so lazy that I even opened the
definition of a function by clicking the function name with Ctrl pressed, rather
than just reading the docs and pressing F12.</p>
<p>Then, I saw some guy's YouTube video on his workflow setup. The way he navigated
through his code and tabs just made me go, &quot;Wow.&quot; I decided to give it a try,
but I didn't have any previous experience with Linux other than just using it
inside a virtual machine for 30 minutes. The next day, I installed Linux Mint
and started my Linux journey.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, here are the major changes that happened to me.</p>
<h2>1 Text Editing </h2> 
I switched from VSCode to Vim and can confidently say that Vim has become an
integral part of my programming toolkit. The initial learning curve was steep,
but the investment in mastering Vim's commands paid off exponentially.
`Treesitter + telescope + harpoon + LSP ` is all you need to get started. It
made my programming more fun, and it's nice to have a little hobby of setting up
your own configs, plugins, etc. Also, most importantly, I can now say "I USE
NEOVIM BTW" to my friends 🗿.
</br>
</br>
<h2>2 Window Management </h2>
The window manager is—just like the name describes—a window manager. It controls
the positioning of windows, their look and feel, etc. I use dwm, which has
transformed the way I interact with applications and manage windows. Here, I
follow a general rule while launching applications. Like Firefox goes to the 1st
tab. Similarly, Discord in 8th, etc. So there is no unnecessary mess going on. I
know exactly where I should go, no more decision-making from a large list of
applications.
</br>
</br>
<h2>3 Browsing </h2> 
I use Firefox browser with the Vimium plugin enabled. It provides keyboard
shortcuts for navigation and control in the spirit of Vim, which also increases
my muscle memory with Vim 😉. I highly recommend this plugin for those who wish
to jump to Vim from VSCode or other editors. But it is just a plugin; it has
many limitations. I strongly believe that a new browser incorporating proper Vim
motions has the potential to become a highly successful product.
