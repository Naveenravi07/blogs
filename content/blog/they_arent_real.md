Living in a life where you cant find out whats going wrong with you is terrible.
You cant hold a real conversation. All of em seems fake.

## **So what's the deal here?**
1. This blog is going to be a part of my [website](https://theshastri.xyz), and I have some plans to
   keep this blog for my whole life. This way, I can document my life and share my thoughts and
   experiences, and people can know me even after I die.
2. I might shitpost  here like i do in twitter.
3. I also really want to improve my English, and this seems like a great way for me.

<br>

## **On this blog, I will write about... ?**
1. My life.
2. Software and tools.
3. Movies/TV shows.
4. It can be anything, so this list is not exhaustive.

<br>

## Some words regarding my poor writing: I want to make this clear: I am not good with English. So,
don't expect high literature from me. I write in the exact same manner as I speak. I would love to
get corrected, so if you find any spelling or grammar mistakes, please feel free to point them out.
